Repository comes with a requirements.txt file containing all the names of all necessary python libraries to run this code.

### How to Run

To run the program in full, first run profile-scrape.py and ensure that the links are output, then use whatever you want (I used Vim) to make a uniquelinks.txt file ensuring each URL is unique. If you do not care about unique links, rename links.txt to uniquelinks.txt, then run profile-to-pdf.py to store a random sample of profiles in PDF format.
